This is my homelab

# Info




## Docker Compose

### Homepage

Homepage needs to have nginx proxy manager running to have access to docker stats.

#### Notice
I have commited several private env variables in my git history. This was not intentinal and since then I have changed said materials internally and removed the old-unused private info from me repo.
